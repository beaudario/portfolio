      I'm a passionate software developer with an MBO degree in Software
      Development and currently pursuing an Associate degree as a software
      developer at Saxion University of Applied Sciences. I enjoy working
      primarily in backend development, using languages like C# and Python.

    <p class="pt-6 text-wrap text-lg lg:text-xl">
      Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving into lower-level languages like C++ and Rust,
      which has been both a challenging and rewarding journey. While these
      languages demand a deeper understanding of memory management and
      performance optimization, they provide valuable insights into how software
      interacts with hardware. The learning curve is steep, but the satisfaction
      of solving complex problems and gaining a more in-depth knowledge of
      systems programming makes it a fun and exciting experience.

      This portfolio is built using Vue.js, HTML, and Tailwind CSS to showcase
      some of my favorite projects. I'm always eager to learn and take on new
      challenges in the ever-evolving world of software development.
