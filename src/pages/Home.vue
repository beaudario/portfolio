        I'm a passionate software developer with an MBO degree in Software
        Development and currently pursuing an Associate degree as a software
        developer at Saxion University of Applied Sciences. I enjoy working
        primarily in backend development, using languages like C# and Python.
        <br /><br />
        Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving into lower-level languages like C++ and Rust,
        which has been both a challenging and rewarding journey. While these
        languages demand a deeper understanding of memory management and
        performance optimization, they provide valuable insights into how
        software interacts with hardware. The learning curve is steep, but the
        satisfaction of solving complex problems and gaining a more in-depth
        knowledge of systems programming makes it a fun and exciting experience.
        <br /><br />
        This portfolio is built using Vue.js, HTML, and Tailwind CSS to showcase
        some of my favorite projects. I'm always eager to learn and take on new
        challenges in the ever-evolving world of software development.
